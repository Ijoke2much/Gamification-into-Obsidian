    - Click the sword icon in the dropdown to access the Quest tab.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Notes

-   **React Version:** Uses React 17 for compatibility with Obsidian‚Äôs environment.
-   **Bundling:** `react` and `react-dom` are marked as externals in the build config.
-   **TypeScript:** Use `@types/react@17` and `@types/react-dom@17` for type safety.
-   **Known Issues:** React 18+ APIs (like `createRoot`) are not supported in the main plugin UI. Use `ReactDOM.render` and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`.
